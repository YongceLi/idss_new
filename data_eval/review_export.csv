Ford,Bronco,"Waited two years on a waiting list and ended up with Badlands and 2.7 with Soft Top. Original Order was for a First Edition and when we were told the Top would not be molded in color due to manufacturing issues, we changed from the limited production First Edition to the combination above. Was completely blown away at the ride and handling versus our Wrangler. Still love the Wrangler, but the Bronco is so much more refined from both on and off road use. The openness of the roll cage versus the Wrangler was a great surprise as well. Had the typical first year production gremlins that i've experienced in Asian, German, and American vehicles we were early adopters of; comes with the territory and Ford stayed in touch and took care of them as they came up. Never driven anything outside of a military HUMMV that was this confidence inspiring off road, in the water, launching jet skis with no boat ramp, i mean at the turn of a dial all the off road modes did what was asked of them. Interior Noise shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's owned a soft top Jeep. Interior material and drains holes for rinsing the sand and mud out were great.

Tesla,Model-3,"Needed a new car. I had no intention of buying an EV, let alone a Tesla. My wife wanted to check out EVs, so I reluctantly agreed. First we drove some plug-in hybrids. Meh. Then she showed me the price of a Model 3 and I agreed to test drive it. 1. You schedule test drive via online. We found it super convenient. Knew exactly when and where we would be test driving, no waiting in carlot for some idiot car salesman. 2. Sign in, Tesla rep greets us and lets us look around, then explains to us how to use the features. No sales pushing, just answering all our questions. 3. Supposed to be a 30 min test drive, we couldn't stop, went for an hour. It was thought changing. I went from being EV skeptic, to Tesla enthusiast in 60 min. 4. Went online and bought a car that afternoon. Again, no scumbag slimy car salesman, everything straight forward and easy. 5. Did have to download the app to finish the process to fill out the paperwork. But, this was fine, do it from living room couch rather than in a crazy office with some sales idiot bugging you to buy some stupid extras. 6. The only hiccup, app prompts you to pay before picking up car. I just messaged in the app that I preferred to see car before paying. Response, No problem. 7. Pickup fast efficient trouble free. People were great. The whole experience left us thinking, this all works together so well. Everything is well thought out and customer experience well thought out. Car is just a pleasure to drive. Fun, fast, quiet, fast, handles well. Relaxing to drive in traffic. With tax credits, cheaper than a Camry. We did get a wall charger, makes the ownership sooo much better. Just plug it in every night and never worry about range for normal commuting. Day three, first day commuting, we got a weird rock ding and broke front passenger door window. Got home. Called service (they answered fast) and the recommended using app to schedule service. (They offered to schedule over phone, but I wanted to try the app). Tried it, flawless to schedule service. Asked you to describe problem, take some pics and submit. Within minutes, got a message that a mobile appointment was scheduled. App asked for insurance, and that was it. Tech showed up in service time. Fixed window fast, answered a bunch of questions we had about features and then was off. No muss, no fuss. Mobile service was AWESOME! Oh, total cost to us was $0. Fit and finish great Driving in rain great 500 mile road trip with family of four great. Total cost, $16. Time at supercharger, 14 min from 30% to 95%. People complain about no car play/android auto, non issue. Tesla navigation is outstanding. Phone Bluetooth connects for calls. Connectivity lets you connect to streaming services you subscribe to. Don't care about carplay/android auto anymore, its irrelevant. You do have to take some time to learn how to use everything but its time well spent as there's sooo much there for you to tailor the car to how you want things. Tesla Model 3 LWD/AWD.

Ford,F-150,"I purchased the Ford f150 single cab with extended bed, & the 2.7 liter 6 cylinder. Everything was great. I bought the truck because my ford Ranger was getting a lot of miles & having issues. Needed something reliable. On my way home from work, I stopped at the grocery store, when I was ready to leave, I turn the key & it wouldn't start or even crank up at all. My display was showing multiple faults like brakes, camera, blind spot lights, among many other faults. The brake lights came on and wouldn't shut off until the battery went completely dead. It was 7pm. I went to the ford app & ordered a tow truck which did not arrive. By 1am I tried calling the tow truck company & they never answered. I called AAA which I should have done to begin with & even they didn't show up until 6am. I sat in my truck for 11 hrs in the grocery store parking lot totally stranded. By 8am I called the ford dealer to get a tow truck to my house & was furious by that point. A tow truck arrived a couple hours later to take the truck to the dealer I bought it from. The dealer tells me there's 35 vehicles ahead of me waiting for service & it will be a while before they could even look at my truck. It's been 5 days & they still haven't looked at it. The day I bought the truck the sales person told me I wouldn't have any problems but if I did, they would take care of me emediatly. So glad I didn't trade in my 2011 ford ranger because I'm self employed & would be losing a lot of money and business. I bought my 2024 f150 just 6 weeks ago and it's already broke down and unusable!

Honda,CR-V,"Having owned multiple CRVs, I've observed a significant improvement in cabin noise reduction compared to earlier models, particularly when the trunk is open during operation. Furthermore, the headrest design has been enhanced, providing a more comfortable and ergonomic experience compared to previous iterations. Upon Bluetooth connection, the current device does not exhibit the multiple connection attempts observed in the previous model. The inclusion of reclining rear seats is a thoughtful feature, and it would have been particularly appreciated during trips when the children were younger.The vehicle's automatic engine stop-start system, which activates upon brake application, is a feature I find undesirable, despite the option to disable it. The vehicle lacks fog lights . A cargo cover isn't included. Furthermore, the gap is not concealed when the rear seats are in an upright position. It appears that SiriusXM is no longer available as a direct option, and the only way to access it is through streaming. Consequently, my spouse now needs to use a charger or Bluetooth to listen to something other than the radio while driving. I find that adjusting the settings with the steering wheel is somewhat time-consuming. Some individuals have mentioned the absence of a spare tire, whereas all of my vehicles have been equipped with one. Additionally, there is a larger infotainment system. The auto-dimming mirror is a welcome feature. However, the automatic high beams sometimes activate at unexpected moments, so I may need to adjust the settings or disable them entirely.

Honda,CR-V,"I bought the 2026 Honda CR-V Hybrid Sport just two days ago, and Im already extremely frustrated. Before this, I owned a 2017 Ford Explorer Limited, and the difference in quality is simply shocking. The CR-Vs interior feels rushed and careless: cheap, rough plastics, poorly cut panels with even sharp edges. The lower dashboard is so thin and flimsy it feels like it could break with a light touch. The carpet is embarrassingly low quality, and the trunk is poorly designed, with no molded lining to organize the space. To make matters worse, the tailgate doesnt even open with the remote  something that should be standard in any modern car. The infotainment system is laughably basic, with very few features for a car at this price point. The USB ports are outdated and slow  and in 2026, not including a fast-charging USB-C is downright ridiculous. On top of that, there are no parking sensors, neither front nor rear, a feature that has become standard even in much cheaper vehicles.

Acura,ADX,"This is has been a great buy so far. The value that you get on the top trim, compared to other luxury entry level SUVs, is simply unbeatable. This trim comes loaded with all the latest driver-assist technology and the music produced by its 15 speaker sound system is outstanding. Some may knock the ADXs 190 horse power engine; however, the car is fast enough for me. After all, I am more interested in a comfortable quiet ride than in winning a car race. UPDATE: I love my new Acura ADX. It looks sporty and while the engine power gets a bad rap, the ride on the individual sports/comfort mode is just a perfect combination of power and luxury ride. The top trim has most of the luxury SUVs bells and whistles, including a super nice sound system with 15 speakers that sounds fantastic. The infotainment is very easy to use.

Not only that, it made in Kentucky. The 2025 Camry restyling is eye catching. Have the white pearl color. Black interior. Have yet to open panoramic sun roof,(probably never use it). Instrumentation panel is very interactive and pretty easy to use while driving. Our Rav4 was typical suv noisy. But this Camry made me understand why the loyalty to Camry. Drives very well. In cruise mode it does all the safety features well. Braking and lane departure. Getting in no problem, getting out tells me I need to lose a pound and wish I was 10 years younger.

Anything over 55mph on a concrete highway and you cant hear the stereo unless its at half volume, and forget about having any type of conversation. Its noisy!!

Honda,Civic,"My Civic history goes back 50 years to a new 1976 Hatch CVCC, I also had an '80 and '83 of that generation. New baby, low income at the time, long commute, dependable were key considerations. 40 years go by and I got the next Honda - a 2024 ST Hatch last January after ""growing up"" and selling my Golf ""R"". I was disappointed with the driving dynamic and CVT after the Golf R manual. I tested the ST hybrid in November and was amazed by the difference that 20 hp and 50 lb-ft of torque and the difference in ""transmission"" with the electric motor makes. Amazing! Otherwise its the same great CIvic. Nits are the passenger seat position, stock tires, absence of homelink and SXM. I've adapted and accepted the later two. I'll upgrade the tires after I get a year or so out of them. That will improve handling further and maybe the road noise. Passengers will not notice the seating. I'll get a little towel for lumbar support. I paid sticker for the 2024 ST Hatch - $32,500.

Ram,1500,"I had a 2015 Outdoorsman with a winch and after market rear bumper. It went 75K miles for me and then finally let me down while towing a 6500 lb travel trailer and it was going to be at least a week or two as no one could figure out what was wrong. Well, they still offered my over 5,000 bucks more than a year ago on a trade and this new one a ""Built to Serve"" edition was sitting there and the final price was right at the one I bought six years ago for financing. So, what has changed in five years? Well they are four inches longer. I didn't know that but do every time I try to park it. There are more bells and whistles for sure. So, here at first what stands out? It is the luxurious feel of this truck. I mean it is so smooth driving it is amazing. It is quiet inside and the dogs love the back with their extra four inches of space with the seats up out of the way. The truck is NOT my daily driver anymore and is mostly dedicated to towing the trailer and going to the transfer station and some light off roading in interesting places here in Montana. It certainly has the equipment to do that so now it is just seeing how it does over time. First impressions are a highly refined but still assuredly a beast. I got it to tow and it has the tow package. THAT I like including the trailer TPMS monitor. The sleeper package I didn't really want was the Ramboxes and the new ""barn door"" tailgate. OK, two weeks into it and I am really starting to like them. The Ramboxes are huge and FOR MY NEEDS, don't get in the way of space in the bed. AND, Going to the transfer station I open the doors and not the ""tail gate"" and can reach everything instead of having to throw half my body on the tail gate to reach stuff. OH, get the premium light package period. The LED headlights are worth their weight in gold compared to the old ones. Make that a must. But if gas mileage is a problem for you? Get a prius. Well, I got rid of the 1500. Not because I had a problem as such, but because it didn't tow my 6700 lb travel trailer as good as I needed. I bought a ""22"" 2500 in the same color and love it. So, IF you do NOT tow over 6000 lbs, I would actually go for a 1500 over a 2500. The Gen 5 1500 in a Bighorn trim and up is essentially a luxury daily driver with some very good capabilities for towing...up to around 6K in perfect comfort. The ride vs a 2500 is amazing. The 2500 is a truck and rides like a truck. It has the luxurious interior but less room in the cab as the dogs will attest to. I loved my 1500's all three of them, but IF you are going to tow and generally go above 6K on your trailer and above 25 feet, you might want to consider a 2500. It is a completely different ""towing"" experience...in a good way. A 2500 will be more ""planted"" and less subject to the wind. A 1500 never lets you forget you are towing...something that big... A 2500 gives you a bit more peace of mind and less stress... But basically, on both of them, I was happy...",4,4,7/15/2022,"[{""make"": ""Ram"", ""model"": ""1500"", ""year"": 2022, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer appreciates the luxurious feel, smooth driving, and towing capabilities of the Ram 1500, especially in the 'Built to Serve' edition.""}, {""make"": ""Ram"", ""model"": ""2500"", ""year"": 2022, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer expresses satisfaction with the 2500 for towing over 6000 lbs, highlighting its stability and comfort.""}]","[{""make"": ""Ram"", ""model"": ""1500"", ""year"": 2015, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer mentions that the 2015 Ram 1500 did not tow their 6700 lb travel trailer as well as needed.""}]","[{""make"": ""Ram"", ""model"": ""1500"", ""year"": 2022, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer appreciates the luxurious feel, smooth driving, and towing capabilities of the Ram 1500, especially in the 'Built to Serve' edition.""}, {""make"": ""Ram"", ""model"": ""2500"", ""year"": 2022, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer expresses satisfaction with the 2500 for towing over 6000 lbs, highlighting its stability and comfort.""}]","[{""make"": ""Ram"", ""model"": ""1500"", ""year"": 2015, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer mentions that the 2015 Ram 1500 did not tow their 6700 lb travel trailer as well as needed.""}]","The reviewer is looking for recommendations on trucks that excel in towing capabilities, particularly for heavier loads, while also considering comfort and luxury features.","[""Ram""]","[""1500"", ""2500""]","[2015, 2022]",new,8,The reviewer prefers newer models for better features and performance.,truck,gas,7,"The reviewer values towing capacity and comfort, especially for larger trailers.","Conversational and detailed, with personal anecdotes and specific preferences.","Engaging and informative, looking for tailored recommendations based on personal experiences.","The user has a family that includes dogs, which influences their need for space in a vehicle, particularly for towing and comfort during travel.","The user seeks recommendations for new trucks that excel in towing capabilities, particularly for heavier loads, while also providing comfort and luxury features.","I'm looking for a new truck, ideally a Ram 2500 or a newer Ram 1500, since I need something that can tow over 6000 lbs comfortably.

BMW,X5,"I like this car very much. I look forward to driving it and look for excuses to drive around and trips to take. So, let me just focus on the Cons: - The ride is jarring on rough roads. (I do not have the air suspension) Made more so by the run flat tires, which in principle I like. The run flats on a cold day on poorly maintained road is not pleasant. - The wide pillars increase blind spots. But if that is a trade off for safety in a crash, I'll take the wide pillars. - Back seat is comfortable but only adequately spacious. - No reclining rear seats. - Harmon Kardon system is only adequate. - Steering can be a little bit light and disconnected at times in some circumstances. - The single panel info screen looks a little awkward and could be better integrated. I think I prefer the two screen set-up with the ""gauge cluster"" buried in front of the driver. Knowing all this I still chose this car because all of Pros easily outweigh the Cons. The Pros are well covered in all of the rave reviews this machine gets, and I conquer. Note: The ""safety"" features are well integrated and easy to shut off. They stay off too, except for the greatest consumer hoax of all time, the Auto-Start-Stop ""feature"", appropriately, ASS. For this you create a short cut and its as easy to turn off it was with the button. You can no longer ""code"" it out, as in previous models.

BMW,X5,"Weve had the car now for almost a year. Very pleased with the vehicle, less so with the dealer. No maintenance issues after about five thousand miles. The handling, acceleration, and technology are superb. It takes awhile to learn the tech but thats true of ALL new vehicles. Most of it is pretty logical. A couple of minor nits: some glare from the drivers upper air vent reflecting into the side mirror should use black rather than silver. Too many button pushes instead of knobs for heat and air. Garage door refuses to pair with our opener had no trouble with 6 other cars. The car DOES run fine on regular and despite the howls from the purists, it states right in the manual that using regular gas WILL NOT hurt the engine. Fuel mileage is outstanding for a vehicle of this weight and performance I routinely get 28 mpg, even if traffic. Quiet and elegant. The dealership experience, however, both in purchase and in routine service leaves much to be desired. BMW apparently only allows one dealer per midsized city and they can pretty much do as they please regarding add-ons and junk fees. I negotiated to get my price but it wasnt pleasant. They insisted on 5 star reviews when the delivery for a luxury vehicle was 3.5 stars , maybe. The salesperson was upset when I gave them an honest review. A scheduled routine oil change took nearly 3 hours ! Another 3 star reviewno follow up to ask why. I bought a second BMW 9 months later because I was impressed with the car but drove two hours to use a different dealer. Much better treatment.

Hyundai,Tucson,"Due to age and mileage, I needed to replace my wife's Mercedes R500, which has served us very well for dog hauling, long-distance family trips, and daily use over 90K miles, as well as my S430, which has been a great mile-eater but not used enough. With the nearest MB dealer 90 miles away, and the local indie mech crazy busy, changing brands was a necessity. After searching for a replacement for over a year, and driving 20+ cars, the best choice to meet our needs was a 2025 Tucson Hybrid. It finally arrived last week, and the 2-for-1 deal was concluded with no hassle. I'm a car guy, mostly European sports and luxury, and I have to say the the newest Hyundai Tucson is as competent as any MB, Saab or BMW I've owned at a bargain price (for what it offers). Roomy, great seats, beautiful finishes, and so far 40+ MPG. It's quieter than my S-class, as roomy as you can get in such a small footprint, and with tech and customization of features and drive modes as you can get. I hate CVT's - so the 6-speed auto (plus hybrid drive) are great. Selectable regen is a plus (although when the smallish battery is charged it shuts off). The factory tires aren't the best but they do seem to boost mileage - we'll see how they do in snow. Steering is light and precise - and road manners are excellent. Brakes are good. Visibility is excellent. The hybrid's power is good for most situations - zippy around town, and easy passes on the highway. I'm surprised at how much the car drives on electric power alone - with very smooth transition to the gas engine. The new (for 2025) dash and instrument display is elegant and works great. Climate control is solid. We'll have to see how it is after a few months and more miles, but the initial impression it makes couldn't be better.",5,5,10/18/2024,"[{""make"": ""Hyundai"", ""model"": ""Tucson"", ""year"": 2025, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer praises the 2025 Tucson Hybrid for its spaciousness, fuel efficiency, and overall performance.""}]","[{""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""R500"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer replaced the R500 due to age and mileage, indicating a preference to move away from it.""}, {""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""S430"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer mentions the S430 was not used enough, suggesting a lack of interest in keeping it.""}, {""make"": null, ""model"": null, ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""unspecified"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer expresses a dislike for CVTs, indicating a preference against vehicles with this transmission type.""}]","[{""make"": ""Hyundai"", ""model"": ""Tucson"", ""year"": 2025, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer praises the 2025 Tucson Hybrid for its spaciousness, fuel efficiency, and overall performance.""}]","[{""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""R500"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer replaced the R500 due to age and mileage, indicating a preference to move away from it.""}, {""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""S430"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer mentions the S430 was not used enough, suggesting a lack of interest in keeping it.""}, {""make"": null, ""model"": null, ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""unspecified"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer expresses a dislike for CVTs, indicating a preference against vehicles with this transmission type.""}]","The reviewer is looking for a reliable and efficient vehicle that meets their family's needs, particularly for long-distance travel and daily use.","[""Hyundai"", ""Mercedes""]","[""Tucson"", ""R500"", ""S430""]",[2025],new,10,"The reviewer specifically purchased a new 2025 model, indicating a strong preference for brand new vehicles.",SUV,hybrid,8,"The reviewer values spaciousness, fuel efficiency, and advanced technology features.","Concise and informative, with a focus on specific features and personal experiences.","Direct and straightforward, seeking clear recommendations based on preferences.","The user has a family and requires a vehicle for long-distance trips, daily use, and dog hauling, indicating a need for practicality and space.","The user is looking for a new, spacious hybrid SUV that offers fuel efficiency and advanced technology features, with a strong preference for the latest model.","I'm looking for a new 2025 SUV, preferably a Hyundai Tucson Hybrid, as I need something spacious and fuel-efficient for family trips and daily use.

Toyota,RAV4,"Love the very impressive gas mileage but that's about it. The seat isn't the most comfortable with the front edge of the drivers seat high and firm for those that drive with their legs extended and there is no way to adjust it lower. If you drive close to the wheel with knees bent, that shouldn't be a problem. The ""lane assist"" must be the worse idea anyone has ever had. Hate having the steering wheel (car) try to take control. The first time it happened was disturbing. It felt like I had to literally fight to control the car where I wanted to go when giving bicycle riders extra room as I passed. Good thing it can be disabled! I found the shifting to be somewhat harsh going into second and third gear when gently accelerating but seems to be improving both on the gentile and more normal accelerations after 850 miles. It rides over bumps and road imperfections more like a truck than a sedan. Road noise was okay but when a rear window is fully opened the interior suffers from a pulsating air compression effect where waves or blasts of air permeate.

Toyota,RAV4,"I got a 2024 RAV4 XLE Premium model, and Im really disappointed with the vehicle. I expected much better quality from Toyota, especially from the RAV4. First of all, the quality of the interior could be much better. Its a little noisy, and the assembly feels subpar, like it was put together in a backyard. Secondly, after just 8,000 km, the vehicle started leaking oil from the oil pan. The service technician told me its a common issue because Toyota stopped using a gasket on the oil pan and now relies only on silicone sealant. Another frustrating issue is the digital speedometer. I cant get used to it. When the sun is behind you, it's nearly impossible to see your speed while driving.

Chevrolet,Traverse,"Man, Chevrolet just hit it out of the park with this one. The redesigned 2024 Traverse looks like a truck. Bigger than any other mid-sized SUV, more space compared to all midsize SUVs, best looking mid sized SUV. Everything is grand and big. Very comfortable seats. Engine is 4-cyl with turbo and works adequately. Will make a sound when accelerated or pushed hard but not a deal breaker. The infotainment system/screen and tech is amazing. Rear view camera, park assist, 360 degree camera. Ambient lighting. Mind blown! My first American car after having 4 japanese cars (3 Mazdas and 1 Suzuki) and 1 German (BMW). I am amazed. Hopefully this wont break because I am hearing complaints about failed transmission from some Z71 AWD twin clutch vehicles. I get an average of about 22 in city and 28 on the highways. Wish there was a hybrid option but then I remembered Toyota Grand Highlander has a stop sale on their models. Honda pilot, Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade doesn't have as of writing this review in Sep 2024. Mazda CX-90 was my other choice but it has no space in the 3rd row and behind the 3rd row.

Chevrolet,Traverse,"We have just over 2000 miles on our RS, which is our third Traverse. We drove from Illinois to Houston, and I will say that super cruise is one of those things that you didn't you needed until you got it. It makes interstate driving much less tiring and I think safer as it allows you to better monitor what is going on around you. The tech is great. I can just say the destination and away we go, no punching in addresses. My one gripe is the tailgate. The kick was so much better. The new gate is not hands free to close, which is when you really need it. And you need to stay away from the back of the car if you have the key and you don't want the tailgate to open.

Chevrolet,Malibu,"The 1.5T engine has not been updated since the 2016 model year and has the lowest horsepower and worst fuel economy in the midsize sedan class. Additionally, there is no all-wheel drive or a hybrid powertrain option. The interior has not been updated since the 2016 model year and uses low quality materials everywhere. The instrument gauge cluster and A/C controls are severely outdated for a $30k car in 2024. The rear passenger A/C vents do not have USB charging ports, and the wireless phone charger is incompatible with newer phone models. The road and tire noise is excessively loud. The technology is several years behind the competition. LED headlights are only available on the highest trim level. The highest 2LT trim level does not come standard with adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring, or rear cross-traffic alert. Competitors offer these features standard on all trim levels. For the MSRP of $30k, youre better off buying a Japanese or Korean competitor.
