Hyundai,Tucson,"Due to age and mileage, I needed to replace my wife's Mercedes R500, which has served us very well for dog hauling, long-distance family trips, and daily use over 90K miles, as well as my S430, which has been a great mile-eater but not used enough. With the nearest MB dealer 90 miles away, and the local indie mech crazy busy, changing brands was a necessity. After searching for a replacement for over a year, and driving 20+ cars, the best choice to meet our needs was a 2025 Tucson Hybrid. It finally arrived last week, and the 2-for-1 deal was concluded with no hassle. I'm a car guy, mostly European sports and luxury, and I have to say the the newest Hyundai Tucson is as competent as any MB, Saab or BMW I've owned at a bargain price (for what it offers). Roomy, great seats, beautiful finishes, and so far 40+ MPG. It's quieter than my S-class, as roomy as you can get in such a small footprint, and with tech and customization of features and drive modes as you can get. I hate CVT's - so the 6-speed auto (plus hybrid drive) are great. Selectable regen is a plus (although when the smallish battery is charged it shuts off). The factory tires aren't the best but they do seem to boost mileage - we'll see how they do in snow. Steering is light and precise - and road manners are excellent. Brakes are good. Visibility is excellent. The hybrid's power is good for most situations - zippy around town, and easy passes on the highway. I'm surprised at how much the car drives on electric power alone - with very smooth transition to the gas engine. The new (for 2025) dash and instrument display is elegant and works great. Climate control is solid. We'll have to see how it is after a few months and more miles, but the initial impression it makes couldn't be better.",5,5,10/18/2024,"[{""make"": ""Hyundai"", ""model"": ""Tucson"", ""year"": 2025, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer praises the 2025 Tucson Hybrid for its spaciousness, fuel efficiency, and overall performance.""}]","[{""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""R500"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer replaced the R500 due to age and mileage, indicating a preference to move away from it.""}, {""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""S430"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer mentions the S430 was not used enough, suggesting a lack of interest in keeping it.""}, {""make"": null, ""model"": null, ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""unspecified"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer expresses a dislike for CVTs, indicating a preference against vehicles with this transmission type.""}]","[{""make"": ""Hyundai"", ""model"": ""Tucson"", ""year"": 2025, ""condition"": ""new"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer praises the 2025 Tucson Hybrid for its spaciousness, fuel efficiency, and overall performance.""}]","[{""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""R500"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer replaced the R500 due to age and mileage, indicating a preference to move away from it.""}, {""make"": ""Mercedes"", ""model"": ""S430"", ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""used"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer mentions the S430 was not used enough, suggesting a lack of interest in keeping it.""}, {""make"": null, ""model"": null, ""year"": null, ""condition"": ""unspecified"", ""rationale"": ""The reviewer expresses a dislike for CVTs, indicating a preference against vehicles with this transmission type.""}]","The reviewer is looking for a reliable and efficient vehicle that meets their family's needs, particularly for long-distance travel and daily use.","[""Hyundai"", ""Mercedes""]","[""Tucson"", ""R500"", ""S430""]",[2025],new,10,"The reviewer specifically purchased a new 2025 model, indicating a strong preference for brand new vehicles.",SUV,hybrid,8,"The reviewer values spaciousness, fuel efficiency, and advanced technology features.","Concise and informative, with a focus on specific features and personal experiences.","Direct and straightforward, seeking clear recommendations based on preferences.","The user has a family and requires a vehicle for long-distance trips, daily use, and dog hauling, indicating a need for practicality and space.","The user is looking for a new, spacious hybrid SUV that offers fuel efficiency and advanced technology features, with a strong preference for the latest model.","I'm looking for a new 2025 SUV, preferably a Hyundai Tucson Hybrid, as I need something spacious and fuel-efficient for family trips and daily use.
